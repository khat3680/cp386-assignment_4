  CP386_ A4 : Bankers Algorithm
</h1>


<br/>

## About the project

- In this asssignment we have to write a multi-thread program that implements the banker's algorithm. Customers request and release resources from the bank. The banker will keep track of the resources. The banker grants request if it satisfies the safety algorithm. If a request does not leave the system in a safe state the banker will deny it.

## Motivation

- We made this project as a part of our assignment (assignment 4) for CP386 as it was a great learning experince.
- We decided to do this project because it is a requirement for the compeltion of our Operating Systems course at University.

## Installation

- C Programming language
- GCC Complier
- A Linux Enviornment 

### _REQUIREMENTS:_ Compile and run on **Linux** or **VM running linux shell** (Made on Ubuntu)

1. Download the file as you would a normal Github Repository.

1. Transfer to your VM if necessary and put into a seperate folder.

1. Use Makefile command **"make"** without quotes for compilation using C99.

    1. "make warnings_ok" for ignoring warnings.

1. Run on linux using "./Assignment_4 X X X X"  --replace X X X X with the Max Resources you desire.

    1. you may check file name by typing "ls", the created file will be highlited green.

    1. an input file has been provided to you for convinience.

1. If an emergency stop is required you may use "CTRL+C" on your keyboard to abort the program.

```c
int main();   // anshul and pranav

void load_c_resources(); // anshul and pranav
void start_program();     // pranav

void display_status();    // pranav
char *resources_request(int cust_number, int *request); // pranav
char *release_resources(int cust_number, int *request);  // anshul
void begin_resources(); //anshul and pranav
 
bool is_safety_check();  //anshul

char *handle_request(char *input, int len, char *(*func)(int, int *)); // anshul and pranav

int *string_to_int_array(char *msg, char *delimeter, int len); // anshul
void print_proper_array(int *arr, int len);   //anshul and pranav
```
## Features
1. Error checking for case sensitive commands.
2. String split using fgets instead of scanf for saftey of buffer.
3. Error checking for requesting or releasing more unnecessary number of resources.


## TESTS

EX: ./193313680_193272030_a04 10 10 10 10

    RQ 0 1 1 1 1

    RQ 2 9 9 9 9

    RL 2 9 9 9 9

    *

    RUN

## CODE EXAMPLE

RQ: Request Resource
RL: Release Resource
* : Show current resources
RUN: Run safety Algorithm and find Safe sequence
999: Stop the program


Commands are case sensitive
